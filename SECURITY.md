## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Operation Abundance Eden Project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the vulnerability details

Alternatively, you can open a security advisory at:
https://github.com/CramerConsultingGroup/operation_abundance_eden_project/security/advisories/new

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its impact and severity
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability
4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will notify you and coordinate disclosure
5. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason (including demonstrating additional risk)
- Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.
